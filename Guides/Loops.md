# Loops

## For Loops
`for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)` means:
* From when `i` equals zero;
* As long as `i` is less than three;
* Adding 1 to `i` with each iteration;

`i++` is the same as `i += 1`

## For Each Loops
`foreach (GameObject orb in orbs)` means:
* For each GameObject...
* ... referred to as 'orb' in the loop...
* ... within the 'orbs' list/array

## While Loops
`while (condition)` means
* This loop will iterate until the condition is no longer true

## Do While Loops
```
do
{
// Something
} while (condition)
```
* This code is executed at least once (unlike while loops)
* The loop will continue until the condition is no longer true
